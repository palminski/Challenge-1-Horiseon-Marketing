Fot this challenge I began with the most obvious adjustment, adding the alt elements to the image tags.
For the icons on the right of the page I wasn't sure if it would be better to leave the alt elements empty as they were mostly decorative, but to be safe I included descriptions
The hero was a bit tricky because the image was in the CSS where I couldn't slap an alt onto it, so I added a title to the hero div tag.

speaking of tags, my next step was to change the myriad div tags into more descriptive ones like section, footer, and aside.
when I did this it messsed up the styling a bit on the header due to the CSS refering to div instead of the new tag nav, so I went into that and adjusted it.

I also added a  more descriptive title to the page and made a couple of small adjustments like removing unneccisary bits of code like a image tag that included an unneeded closing tag, as well as adding an ID to the search engine orginization section to the button at the top of the screen would jump to it. I also made clicking the Horiseon in the top left link to the index page.
